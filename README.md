# openStore

Ethereum on-chain media store POC.

This is project is a proof of concept for a decentralized media storage system. It is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and uses the IPFS network for storing the media files. The project is built using the Truffle framework. 

The concept is that of a decentralized Media Store for music. The store is a smart contract that allows users to upload music files and sell them for a price. The store owner can set a price for the store and the store user pays the price to the store owner. One of the great promises of Smart Contact Blockchains is the disintermediation of the music industry, like labels and publishers, by enabling the artists to directly publish their creations and get rewarded fully.
